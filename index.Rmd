For the following statements, drag and drop the correct options for each example into the correct column, identifying the nuisance parameter/s, the parameter/s of interest, and the corresponding probability density function.

1. I want to figure out the average height of statistics students at the University of St Andrews. I have some sample data and anticipate that the heights are normally distributed.
