You're going to sort some questions out! 

I want to figure out the average height of statistics students at the University of St Andrews. I have some sample data and anticipate that the heights are normally distributed. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(sortable)
library(htmltools)

bucket_list(
    header = "Identify the correct options for this example from below and move these to the right spot!",
    add_rank_list(
      text = "Drag options from the first column into their appropriate zones",
      labels = c(
                "two",
                "three",
                htmltools::tags$div("here")
    ),
    add_rank_list(
      text = "This is our nuisance parameter(s)!",
      labels = NULL
    ),
    add_rank_list(
      text = "This is our parameter(s) of interest!",
      labels = NULL
    ),
    add_rank_list(
      text = "This is our probability density function!",
      labels = NULL
    )
  )
```
