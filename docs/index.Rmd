I want to figure out the average height of statistics students at the University of St Andrews. I have some sample data and anticipate that the heights are normally distributed. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(sortable)
library(htmltools)
bucket_list(
    header = "Identify the correct options for this example from below and move these to the right spot!",
    add_rank_list(
      text = "Drag options from the first column into their appropriate zones",
      labels = c("Our data \underbar{$x$} is known.", 
                 "$$X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})$$",
                 "$$P(x) = \frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }}e^{{{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } {2\sigma ^2 }}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {2\sigma ^2 }}}$$",
                 "$$\sigma$$",
                 "$$\mu$$",
                 "heights",
                 "students")
    ),
    add_rank_list(
      text = "This is our nuisance parameter(s)!",
      labels = NULL
      )
    ),
    add_rank_list(
      text = "This is our parameter(s) of interest!",
      labels = NULL
    ),
    add_rank_list(
      text = "This is our probability density function!",
      labels = NULL
    )
  )
```
